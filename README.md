<h2>Making and interpreting predictions from a Bayesian perspective</h2>
<h2>Using the Naive Bayes algorithm to predict whether a movie review is positive or negative</h2>
<h2>Using cross validation to optimize models</h2>
  
<h2>Overview</h2>
  We’ll be working with a CSV file containing movie reviews. Each row contains the text of the review, as well as a number indicating   whether the tone of the review is positive(1) or negative(-1).
We want to predict whether a review is negative or positive, based on the text alone. To do this, we’ll train an algorithm using the reviews and classifications in train.csv, and then make predictions on the reviews in test.csv. We’ll be able to calculate our error using the actual classifications in test.csv to see how good our predictions were.
