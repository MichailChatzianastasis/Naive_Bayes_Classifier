<h2>Making and interpreting predictions from a Bayesian perspective</h2>
<h2>Using the Naive Bayes algorithm to predict whether a movie review is positive or negative</h2>
<h2>Using cross validation to optimize models</h2>
  
<h2>Overview</h2>
  The database contains Movies, derived from the MovieLens dataset. This dataset includes information for about 10,000 movies, including     the IMDB id for each movie. At first we download Rotten Tomatoes reviews from 3000 of these movies, using the Rotten Tomatoes API      (Application Programming Interface). After that,we use a Naive Bayes classifier to build a prediction model for whether a review is fresh  or rotten, depending on the text of the review.
